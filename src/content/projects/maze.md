## Happy Path

If you want to go watch the computer solve the maze, you can go straight to [maze.dan-engel.fyi](https://maze.dan-engel.fyi) to get your path-finding fix.

## The Why

Algorithms are a fundamental realm of knowledge and skill in computer science, and the problems they can be utilized solve are some of the most interesting. They power the little interactive features I have dotted around this site (my sand-falling and flocking simulations), which, although small, are some of the projects of which I'm most proud. I'd also burned out on several consecutive interview-related projects which were heavily reliant on learning vendors or frameworks, an experience is less joyous exploration and more like bomb defusal. I am still proud of those projects and you can try them [here](https://rails-vue-actioncable.herokuapp.com/) and [here](https://master.d1da3qvbxoqw2b.amplifyapp.com/). 

Bottom line is I wanted more joyous exploration, with a dollop of *learning something new*.

## Some thoughts on making a pathfinding algorithm with Vue and Javascript

I did not do this for fun, since it's way more fun to solve a maze yourself than to to watch a maze get solved. It is *satisfying*, in a way, but it is not necessarily fun.
